            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Xie Lian is a kind and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he remains a down-to-earth person. He never holds his status above others and treats others equally disregarding status as a sign of one's worth, shown from how he treats Mu Qing and Feng Xin even when they were his subordinates. 
            <br>
                He is a compassionate man who only wants to help others, going so far as to bend the rules of Heaven. He is indifferent towards the opinions of others and does not hold grudges against them. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he is even willing to save those who have wronged him horribly in the past. 
            <br>
                Similarly, he is deeply loyal to those who are kind to him and those he considers friends. He is extremely polite and even at his angriest seldom uses derogatory or even insulting language. Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, he can also see the best in people, understanding even those that are hard to deal with.
