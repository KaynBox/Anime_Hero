            <h2>Introduction</h2>
             <p>
                 800 years ago <strong>Xie Lian</strong> was known throughout the <strong>Xian Le</strong> nation as the <em>beloved</em> yet <em>strange prince</em>. Never showing interest in what was considered normal for a prince, he simply declared, <strong>"I want to save the common people!".</strong> Through practice, hard work, and insight beyond his years, he perfected his cultivation and <em>ascended to the Heavens</em> at the age of seventeen.
            </p>
            <p>
                After multiple unfortunate events, he was <em>twice banished</em> from the Heavens. But now, 800 years later, he ascended for the third time, shocking the Heavens once more.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Xie Lian is a <strong>kind</strong> and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he <em>remains a <strong>down-to-earth</strong></em> person. He is a <strong>compassionate</strong> man who only wants to help others, going so far as to <em>bend the rules of Heaven.</em> He is indifferent towards the opinions of others and does not hold grudges against them. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he is even <em><strong>willing to save</strong> those who have wronged him horribly in the past.</em> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, <em>he can also <strong>see the best</strong> in people,</em> understanding even those that are hard to deal with.
