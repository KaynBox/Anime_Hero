            <h2>Introduction</h2>
             <p>
                 <strong>800 years</strong> ago, <strong>Xie Lian</strong> was known throughout the <strong>Xian Le</strong> nation as the <em><strong>beloved</strong></em> yet <em><strong>strange</strong> prince</em>. Never showing interest in what was considered normal for a prince, he simply declared, <strong>"I want to save the common people!".</strong> Through practice, hard work, and insight beyond his years, he perfected his cultivation and <em><strong>ascended</strong> to the Heavens</em> at the age of seventeen.
            </p>
            <p>
                After multiple unfortunate events, he was <em><strong>banished</strong> twice</em> from the Heavens. But now, 800 years later, he <strong>ascended for the third time</strong>, shocking the Heavens once more.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Xie Lian is a <strong>kind</strong> and gentle person. Although he <strong>acknowledges his abilities,</strong> he <em>remains <strong>down-to-earth</strong></em>. He is a <strong>compassionate</strong> man who only wants to help others, going so far as to <em>bend the rules of Heaven.</em> He is <strong>indifferent towards the opinions of others</strong> and <strong>does not hold grudges</strong> against them. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he is even <em><strong>willing to save</strong> those who have wronged him horribly in the past.</em> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, <em>he can also <strong>see the best</strong> in people,</em> <strong>understanding</strong> even those that are hard to deal with.
